                I'll tell you a story
                Before it tells itself
                I'll lay out all my reasons
                You'll say that I need help

                We all have expectations
                And sometimes they go wrong
                No one listens to me
                So I put it in this song
            </p>

                Not that thing in my chest
                Got their hands at my neck this time

                But you're the one that I want
                If that's really so wrong
                Then they don't know what this feeling is like
