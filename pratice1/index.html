            <p>Frankly, it's ludicrous to have these interlocking bodies and not...interlock. My Uncle Rory was the
                stodgiest taxidermist you've ever met by day. But I haven't spent any money! I was all... dead and
                frugal. The only way some people can find a purpose in life is by becoming obsessed with demons. Should
                I start this program over? It's a real burn, being right so often. Can't call to mom, can't say a word.
                Nobody could do that much decoupage without calling on the powers of darkness. I'll never leave. Not
                even if you kill me. If I could make you purtier, I would.

            <p>Everybody started singing and dancing. I've got four brothers, none of them Democrats. They need to take
                seven and they might take yours. Any self-respecting demon should be living in a pit of filth or a nice
                crypt. Who's calling me? Everybody I know lives here. Can't even shout, can't even cry. And I'm a huge
                fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster. I wanna hurt you, but I
                can't resist the sinister attraction of your cold and muscular body! In their resting state, our actives
                are as innocent and vulnerable as children.

                Angel, it's not you. If I was blind, I would see you. Yes, I'd forgotten you're moonlighting as a
                criminal mastermind now.

            <p>The human body can be drained of blood in 8.6 seconds given adequate vacuuming systems. Actually, I was
                fired from a fry-cook opportunity. I'm a comfortador also. Oh my god, I find lentils completely
                incomprehensible. The human mind is like Van Halen; if you just pull out one piece and keep replacing
                it, it just degenerates.

            <p>I saw their production of 'Giselle' in 1890. I wept like a baby, and I was evil! And zombies don't eat
                brains anyway, unless instructed to by their zombie master. It's about power and it's about women and
                you just hate those two words in the same sentence, don't you? She is the slayer. I recognize the
                council has made a decision, but given that it's a stupid-ass decision, I've elected to ignore it.

                people feel like, and Blockbuster. In their resting state, our actives are as innocent and vulnerable as
                children. I'm a rogue demon hunter now. Hey I could whip up a love slave any day I wanted. Oh my god, I
                find lentils completely incomprehensible. Well we could grind our enemies into talcum powder with a
                sledgehammer but, gosh, we did that last night.

            <p>It's funny how the Earth never opens up and swallows you when you want it to. Why can't you just
                masturbate like the rest of us? It's a real burn, being right so often. They need to take seven and they
                might take yours. We're old friends from Navy. Friends from Old Navy. I worked retail, he'd come in, buy
                slacks My entire existence was constructed by a sociopath in a sweater vest; what do you suggest I do?

            <p>Oh my god you will never believe what happened at school today. We're old friends from Navy. Friends from
                Old Navy. I worked retail, he'd come in, buy slacks I'm not planning on presiding over the end of
                Western Civilization. She is the slayer. Everyone's a hero in their own way, in their own not that
                heroic way. Stay away from hyena people, or any loser athletes, or if you see anyone who's invisible.
                These endless days are finally ending in a blaze. What, you think this isn't real just because of all
                the vampires, and demons, and ex-vengeance demons, and the sister that used to be a big ball of
                universe-destroying energy? They need to take seven and they might take yours. I swallowed a bug.

            <p>Only way to fit 5000 species of mammal on the same boat. I've seen the best and the worst of you. The
                only thing Willow was ever good for, the only thing I ever had going for me were those moments, just
                moments, where Tara would look at me and I was wonderful. We've got a bunch of fighters with nothing to
                hit, a wicca who won't-a, and the brains of our operation wears oven mitts. They rampaged through half
                the known world until Angel got his soul.
